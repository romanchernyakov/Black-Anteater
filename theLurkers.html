            Those are the most tasty ones! <br> Hailing from the late 1970s UK punk scene, are a band that embodies the raw and relentless energy of the movement. With their fast-paced, stripped-down punk sound and rebellious attitude, The Lurkers carved out a unique place in the punk-rock landscape. Their music, characterized by catchy hooks, driving guitar riffs, and anthemic choruses, captivated audiences and propelled them to the forefront of the punk scene. Songs like "Shadow," "Ain't Got a Clue," and "I Don't Need to Tell Her" showcased their knack for infectious melodies and relatable lyrics. The Lurkers may have been somewhat overlooked in the grand scheme of punk history, but their impact is undeniable, leaving a lasting imprint on the genre and inspiring countless bands that followed.

Also, I've found short interview with their frontman Arturo (Arthur) Bassick by Amy Britton in 2013: <br> 
<br>
            AB: Arthur, you’re the first person to play Foremans…its obvious that Jason (Foremans landlord) is trying to embody the original DIY ethic of punk by putting on these gigs…is that something you’ve always felt a part of?
<br>
<br>
ArB: Absolutely, everything with the Lurkers and 999 was DIY, the Lurkers did the first release for the independent label Beggars Banquet, which was especially formed around us. Everything I’ve ever done since has been on a small independent label.
<br>
<br>
AB: Do you think the way people consume music has affected this culture, with the downloading age?
<br>
<br>
ArB: Absolutely. But then again I never likes CD’s either. There wasn’t really a shortage of vinyl like there was supposed to be; they were just trying to make the CD format take over. Vinyls a lovely thing.
<br>
<br>
AB: History tries to make punk seem like a very cohesive scene, I don’t imagine it was really like that…
<br>
<br>
ArB: That’s true, festivals like Rebellion make punk seem like a right love-in compared to how it was!
<br>
<br>
(We somehow get from here to a small rant about the appropriation of punk and its aesthetic by the mainstream and the way the look has been adopted by people with no affiliation to the music…)
<br>
<br>
ArB: The mohawk and the like have been adopted as emblems, but the music itself is getting written out. Look at the way mainstream radio treats punk. They might play “Should I Stay Or Should I Go?” or “Rock The Casbah,” but they never play any Jam, any Sex Pistols…
<br>
<br>
AB: It’s written out of cultural history, but romantacised as well. Its like how you can see the roots of punk in other forms of music, but people talk about a year zero…
<br>
<br>
ArB: Year Zero was a load of bollocks; you can hear the roots in glam for a start.
<br>
<br>
AB: Even up to some of the postpunk that’s seen as completely original you can hear that – some of Wire and Magazine’s stuff, for example, sounds very Roxy Music-esque.
<br>
<br>
ArB: Exactly! I saw Roxy in ’71…
<br>
<br>
ArB: Also, the British punk scene would never have existed without the New York scene. The Ramones were the most important of all in starting it.
<br>
<br>
AB: That reinforces the ideas that all musics successful progressions come from hybrids (Arthur agrees and we trace right back to the hybrids that spawned the blues) – which leads me onto what you’re doing now, “punktry and Western…”
<br>
<br>
ArB: Well I was into country before punk; my brother is 72 and he had all these country records, so really country was the first music I was really into. And I prefer the term “punktry and Western” to “country punk…”
